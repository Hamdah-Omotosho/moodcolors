# Mood of the Day 🌈

## Package Summary
`termcolor` is a lightweight Python package for printing coloured, styled text in the terminal. It helps make console programs clearer — for example, displaying success messages in green, warnings in yellow, and errors in red.  
This mini-project demonstrates how `termcolor` can print motivational messages based on the user’s mood.
